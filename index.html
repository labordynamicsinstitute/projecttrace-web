            <h2>Welcome to the TRACE project!</h2>
            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>Restricted-access data cannot simply be uploaded to journal websites or open archives. In lieu of a complete replication archive, journals instead request information on contents of and access procedures to such data. Most responses to such requests are unsatisfactory: at present, the metadata on confidential data is difficult for authors to provide, costly and burdensome to create, rarely properly curated, and thus often incompletely, if at all, provided to journals. Research using confidential data is therefore sometimes perceived as unable to satisfy two requirements for replicability - adequate description of methods and availability of data.</p>
            <p>However, in order  to release research results based on confidential data, researchers have to document the data used, the methods used to transform the data, and some statistical properties of the results obtained, to the satisfaction of "disclosure review boards" whose job it is to safeguard the data. These activities, in fact, are precisely those required to produce the elements of replicable research. However, in most RADEs, replication materials, or their elements, are not systematically provided to researchers and exposed to the scientific community.  </p>
            <h3>The current state</h3>
            <p> Hence, assembling replication materials  imposes a higher cost on researchers in RADEs. Naturally, many choose to not incur those costs beyond the extent to which the data provider insists as a component of its contract with the researchers. In turn, because few researchers are able to provide complete materials to journals, journals are willing to waive replication requirements lest they miss the opportunity to publish highly influential work. The resulting equilibrium is one in which replicable archives are not provided, and it is harder to replicate studies using confidential data.</p>
            <h3>Our solution</h3>
            <p>Our project, a collaboration between academia and institutions running RADEs, aims to remedy these issues, by tackling them at multiple levels:
            <ul>
              <li>Researchers receive information and training</li>
              <li>Institutions provide improved support and materials to researchers and journals</li>
              <li>Journals are made aware of improved ways to document replicability, and are encouraged to accept alternate, high-quality ways of documenting replicability</li>
            </ul>
            This website provides the basics of this approach. We will expand it as our project evolves.</p>

            <h2>Researchers</h2>
            <p>We will enable greater transparency of research undertaken by academics, graduate students, and agency staff. The methods and procedures developed will be applicable to many restricted access data environments. We will train researchers how to conduct research in a replicable manner, filling a void in the available curricula for replicable research. In addition, we develop new formally private verification measures adapted for replication studies.</p>

            <h2>Activities</h2>
            <h3>Replication challenges</h3>
            <p> We have not finalized how replication challenges will be organized. Our selection of replication targets will initially be made in consultation with RADE researchers. In the long-term, we seek to to make it feasible to replicate any eligible paper, regardless of participation by the original author. Our process for selecting participants to conduct replication studies is malleable. We foresee a general call for participants, but given our initial discussions, may augment these with more specific calls for capstone projects, cohort of RAs. Ultimately, we aim to provide instructions on how to run "replication challenges" as educational opportunities for interested faculty and students. </p>
            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>We will develop new training materials, based on the existing excellent materials at Software Carpentry and TIER, adapted to the context of restricted access (and often, restricted software) environments.

            <h2>Providers</h2>
            <p>We will work with restricted access data environment (RADE) providers to modify existing processes for disclosure review and tools to track the provenance of datasets, programs, and results. Together, these reduce costs to researchers of preparing replication materials and disclosure memos. We do not propose to add new processes to the (quite intrusive) way research is performed in RADEs; rather we modify existing policies so that the resulting output is publishable and reusable. As a result, all components of the research workflow can be made transparent to other researchers and journals. </p>
            <p>We will, in particular, work with the RADEs to ensure that  "disclosure review request" (DRR) packages, as required by local procedures, are created through a more efficient and user-friendly process, and can serve as a <em>certified replication archive</em>. We note that within RADEs, disclosure review processes are contractually or legally required of all researchers to satisfy  confidentiality protection. Our work will make  DRR packages  serve the secondary purpose of documenting the replicability of research results in an open and referenceable fashion. </p>

            <h2>Journals</h2>
            <p>We will work with journals and other scholarly institutions with the capacity to define replication standards to strengthen expectations about reproducibility of RADE research. In doing so, we seek to develop processes that will allow RADE researchers to more easily provide replication materials, regardless of where the datasets used by the research are curated. We note that in this emerging activity, it will be possible for journals to participate without changing their current practices. However, there is scope for development of clearer standards for providing replication materials. There are multiple actors in this domain (e.g., TOP working group), and the replication packages may need to be adapted to conform to industry-wide standards, when those exist. Our intention here is not to create idiosyncratic new standards, but to make it easier for researchers to comply with existing standards.
