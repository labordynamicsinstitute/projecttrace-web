            <h2>Researchers</h2>
            <p>We will enable greater transparency of research undertaken by academics, graduate students, and agency staff. The methods and procedures developed will be applicable to many restricted access data environments. We will train researchers how to conduct research in a replicable manner, filling a void in the available curricula for replicable research. In addition, we develop new formally private verification measures adapted for replication studies.</p>

            <h2>Activities</h2>
            <h3>Replication challenges</h3>
            <p> We have not finalized how replication challenges will be organized. Our selection of replication targets will initially be made in consultation with RADE researchers. In the long-term, we seek to to make it feasible to replicate any eligible paper, regardless of participation by the original author. Our process for selecting participants to conduct replication studies is malleable. We foresee a general call for participants, but given our initial discussions, may augment these with more specific calls for capstone projects, cohort of RAs. Ultimately, we aim to provide instructions on how to run "replication challenges" as educational opportunities for interested faculty and students. </p>
            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>We will develop new training materials, based on the existing excellent materials at Software Carpentry and TIER, adapted to the context of restricted access (and often, restricted software) environments.

            <h2>Providers</h2>
            <p>We will work with restricted access data environment (RADE) providers to modify existing processes for disclosure review and tools to track the provenance of datasets, programs, and results. Together, these reduce costs to researchers of preparing replication materials and disclosure memos. We do not propose to add new processes to the (quite intrusive) way research is performed in RADEs; rather we modify existing policies so that the resulting output is publishable and reusable. As a result, all components of the research workflow can be made transparent to other researchers and journals. </p>
            <p>We will, in particular, work with the RADEs to ensure that  "disclosure review request" (DRR) packages, as required by local procedures, are created through a more efficient and user-friendly process, and can serve as a <em>certified replication archive</em>. We note that within RADEs, disclosure review processes are contractually or legally required of all researchers to satisfy  confidentiality protection. Our work will make  DRR packages  serve the secondary purpose of documenting the replicability of research results in an open and referenceable fashion. </p>

            <h2>Journals</h2>
            <p>We will work with journals and other scholarly institutions with the capacity to define replication standards to strengthen expectations about reproducibility of RADE research. In doing so, we seek to develop processes that will allow RADE researchers to more easily provide replication materials, regardless of where the datasets used by the research are curated. We note that in this emerging activity, it will be possible for journals to participate without changing their current practices. However, there is scope for development of clearer standards for providing replication materials. There are multiple actors in this domain (e.g., TOP working group), and the replication packages may need to be adapted to conform to industry-wide standards, when those exist. Our intention here is not to create idiosyncratic new standards, but to make it easier for researchers to comply with existing standards.
