# TRACE

This project will enable  researchers working within restricted access data environments (e.g. the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers, FSRDC) to generate and document research that clearly satisfies criteria for replicability. We address issues of confidentiality that arise when replication is conducted with restricted access data. We will enable journals to better reveal such information, in a more consistent, transparent manner.
